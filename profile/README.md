## XR Collaboratory

The [XR Collaboratory](https://xrcollaboratory.tech.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) accelerates education and research in virtual and augmented reality with course offerings, projects, and cross-campus collaborations.

Our primary interests are in 3D user interfaces and interaction design for head-mounted displays. We build high-fidelity prototypes with our students through projects and coursework, and collaborate with Cornell faculty on AR/VR-related research across disciplines such as computer vision, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction.

The XR Collaboratory is located on the Cornell Tech campus, one subway stop from Manhattan’s Upper East Side, on Roosevelt Island.

## XRC Toolkit

The [XRC Toolkit](https://xrcollaboratory.github.io/xrc-toolkit/) is a collection of tools and 3D interaction techniques, developed by the XR Collaboratory at Cornell Tech, for accelerating AR/VR prototyping.

**Note:** The XRC Toolkit docs can be found at [xrcollaboratory.github.io/xrc-toolkit](https://xrcollaboratory.github.io/xrc-toolkit/)
