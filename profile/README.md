## XR Collaboratory

The XR Collaboratory at Cornell Tech accelerates education and research in virtual and augmented reality with course offerings, projects, and cross-campus collaborations.

Our primary interests are in 3D user interfaces and interaction design for head-mounted displays. We build high-fidelity prototypes with our students through projects and coursework, and collaborate with Cornell faculty on AR/VR-related research across disciplines such as computer vision, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction.

The XR Collaboratory is located on the Cornell Tech campus, one subway stop from Manhattan’s Upper East Side, on Roosevelt Island.
